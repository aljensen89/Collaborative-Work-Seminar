## Seminar Title: 
Ethnoracial Disparities in Access to Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS)
Creation and Hospital Survival for Acute Variceal Bleeding in the United States

## Abstract: 
Current guidelines recommend transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in
patients with acute variceal bleeding that has not been controlled endoscopically and for those at high risk of
rebleeding. However, prior studies have shown that Black patients die at higher levels than white patients
following TIPS creation in the United States. With increasing awareness of the intrinsic biases and social
determinants of health impacting patient outcomes, ethnoracial-based inequities in the care of patients with
acute variceal bleeding required a focused study. Using data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from
2007-2016, all patients aged > 18 years admitted with a principal diagnosis of acute variceal bleeding were
included for analysis. Hospital processes of first-line treatments (endoscopy and blood transfusions) and TIPS
were identified and their day of performance (from time of admission) were calculated; in-hospital mortality after
TIPS creation as well as procedural complications were also classified. Hierarchical multivariable logistic
regressions were fit to test for associations between the outcomes of interest (endoscopy, TIPS, and mortality
following TIPS) and patient race while controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Black patients
had lower odds of receiving endoscopy (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.74-0.91; p<0.001), TIPS (OR 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45-
0.72; p<0.001), and had higher odds of in-hospital mortality following TIPS (OR 3.01; 95% CI: 1.55- 5.84;
p=0.001), all else equal. A sensitivity analysis was performed among patients without ascites (a maximum
possible Child-Pugh score of 13) for the outcome of in-hospital mortality; on this subset, Black race was no
longer significantly associated with the outcome (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.4-3.6; p=0.68). This suggests that the
marked racial disparity in mortality may be due to Black patients having a disproportionately higher disease
severity at the time of TIPS creation. The fact that Black patients appear to have more advanced disease when
TIPS is created speaks to the inequitable management of their disease course preceding it, including their
access to first line treatments and, ultimately, TIPS creation. Collectively, these findings suggest a need for
public health and policy efforts to focus on disparities in the upstream management of decompensated liver
disease.
